# Microsoft Security Ecosystem Overview

## Overview
The Microsoft Security Ecosystem is a collection of integrated security solutions 
designed to protect identities, endpoints, cloud environments, and data. 
It combines detection, prevention, investigation, and response capabilities 
across hybrid and cloud infrastructures.


## Components
- Microsoft Sentinel (SIEM)
- Defender for Endpoint (EDR)
- Defender for Identity
- Defender for Cloud

## Alert Flow
1. Endpoint generates telemetry
2. Defender analyzes behavior
3. Alert created
4. Sentinel ingests alert
5. Incident correlation happens

## Key Insight
Sentinel does not generate alerts alone — it aggregates and correlates signals.
